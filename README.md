This is fullstack project with backend in SpringBoot and frontend in react.

Backend:

To run this application you need to add a MongoDB URI in application.properties (mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@ticketbooking.ryuljnw.mongodb.net/ticket-booking?retryWrites=true&w=majority)
Replace username and password according to your database. The backend should run on http://localhost:8080. 

Frontend:

To run the frontend go to client directory and run npm install to install all dependency. Then do npm run dev to run the application on http://localhost:5173 (only this site can send the request to backend).
